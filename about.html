            On my free time, you'd most likely find me in the kitchen, on my Xbox, or browsing my closet. These are
            places I find myself often, as my 3 biggest passions are cooking, video games, and fashion. Ever since I was
            a kid, it was always these as my big 3.

            There are a lot of different activities I partake in besides those. I love listening to music, going on
            walks, hiking, and spending time with my friends (basic I know.) I'm always open to trying new things,
            especially when it comes to traveling or food.

            I'm Thomas Plachcinski, a senior graphic designer attending West Virginia University. I grew up in Bellmore,
            New York, and plan on going back there once I graduate. New York is home to me, but i'm always up
            to travel.
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            I have a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for all aspects of design, but I specifically enjoy
            UI/UX and web design. App design is a newfound love for me, and I hope I can capitalize more on this type of
            work in the future.
